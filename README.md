# Bichos-Perdidos.org

## Overview

Application made to help find lost animals in 2024 Brazil's South floods. The objective was to channel all instagram pages to the same place. To accomplish this I made a webscrapper using python to collect all pictures of these pages, upload to a AWS bucket and show then using a Flutter frontend.
